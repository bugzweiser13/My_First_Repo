            <h2>Jason Emerson (aka bugzweiser)</h2>

            <img src="me.jpg" alt="me.jpg">

            <p>I am 44 years old. I was born and raised in Eugene, Oregon (GO DUCKS).  I am a Field Service Engineer for Hyundai Motor America and have been for the past four years.  
                After serving in the United States Navy in the 90's, I relocated here to Southern California.  I started in the automotive field here at the Riverside Auto Center in 2000 while attending Universal Technical Institute (UTI).
                I graduated UTI with honors and I have worked for Ponitac, Buick, Suzuki, Saturn, finally accepting a position with Hyundai of Riverside in 2006 as an Automotive Technician / Shop Foreman.  In 2013, I won the "World's Best Hyundai Technician" through a 
                competition held in Seoul, Korea with 100 competitors from 52 countries.  In 2015, I accepted my current position to challege myself within a new role in my field and to open new doors.</p> 
            <p> I currently "code" as a hobby (started activity December 2018) and why I requested to attend the bootcamp to my employer. I am slated to assist / back-up the current lead in my office as the Internal Web / Application Developer.  I am currently designing a web portal for my department.</p>
            <p>I live here in Riverside. I am married with 4 kids, two grandkids and two dogs (a Shepherd and a Lab). I am a family man with most of my activities centered around family events or get togethers. With that said, I love concerts and all car related activities (races, shows, etc.).  Fun fact,
                I have seen most rock / metal bands there are. I believe I may have an addiction.</p>
